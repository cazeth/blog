You can create markets for most things. Song.tech, for instance, creates a market for a toplist of songs. Draw.tech creates a market for a canvas of colored pixels. Friend.tech creates a market for chat rooms. They are openly managed and shared internet spaces. The idea is that you pay to edit this shared internet space and if you do so in a way that brings it closer to what it will be in the future, you earn. People vote with their wallets and the results follow.

Now, it may seem soul-sucking to combine art with the coldness of money. But it is inevitable that for any list it has to be decided what goes at the top. It could be decided by a person, a company, an algorithm, or as is the case here, a market. And a market is not a market if you do not make it costly but potentially beneficial to participate, and markets produce information.
